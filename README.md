# BetterEdit

This is the branch for the v5 version of BetterEdit, which is only for [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org) - if you're looking for the old standalone version, see the [v4](https://github.com/HJfod/BetterEdit/tree/v4) and [v4-min](https://github.com/HJfod/BetterEdit/tree/v4-min) branches.

### Please note that BE 5 is still in very early stages of development, and many features are yet to add.

However, if you'd like to try the next generation of BetterEdit out for yourself, you can get the latest binary from releases once I get the GitHub action set up.
