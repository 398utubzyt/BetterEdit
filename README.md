# BetterEdit

A mod that makes the GD editor, well, Better.

### The current version of BetterEdit is currently closed source!

Development of BE 5 is being undertaken in a private repository. However, releases for it will be released on this repo as normal.

BE 5 will likely be made open source once I've figured some stuff out. When that happens, it will be merged here as a `v5` branch and that branch will be merged into `main`.

The old version of BE (v1-v4) is available under the `v4` branch. **Please note that the old version sucks.**
